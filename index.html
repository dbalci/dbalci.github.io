    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div>
        I am a nuclear energy engineer turned software engineer. After graduating college I worked as a medical engineer briefly
        and I moved to the United States. I always had an interest in software development. I studied web applications
        development with languages like JavaScripts, Ruby and Python. I have worked with frameworks like Rails, React,
        Express-Node.js. Database systems like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I have developed a Q&A application. Collaborated on an
        airport review application, published them on GitHub. I made myself comfortable with development methodologies and
        testing. I am a self motivated learner and have strong analytical skills. I am looking for a software engineering
        position to expand my horizon and build great applications.
