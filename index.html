        <p>Top 35 Best Free Bootstrap Blog Templates Coded Using HTML5 and CSS3 â€“ 2020
        February 13, 2020Alex IvanovsWebsite Templates24 Comments
        A versatile list of Bootstrap blog templates for any blog category from simple food, fashion and lifestyle blog all way
        to technology and corporate blogs.
        
        A blog is still a website, with its own set of elements and features that create the kind of web design that we are most
        satisfied with. The last decade on the web has proved that blogging is a sustainable method of expressing oneself, as
        well as consuming content in a variety of different ways. Getting started with your own blog has also become somewhat of
        a leisurely experience, a good domain name and a reliable hosting company is all we really need to have our own
        WordPress based blogging enterprise up and running, or we may resort to alternatives like Blogger, Tumblr, amongst
        others.
        
        Whether a creative looking to attract new clients, or a business that realizes the quintessential importance of a blog
        as a medium of generating more leads, blogging has something to offer to all types of web users; even those who have
        never written an intentional paragraph before. Much like a portfolio website works, we can use our blogs to advertise
        our talents, to express our ideas, and to connect with an audience that reaches far beyond the horizon of our
        expectations.
        Why choose Bootstrap blog templates?
